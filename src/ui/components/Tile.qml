// Unified grid tile. Solid card with a centered icon area filling the
// card body, plus an accent-coloured outline ring around the card when
// this tile is the focused selection. Used by every tile surface in the frontend
// — hub categories row, systems grid, games grid, recents grid — so
// the vocabulary is identical across screens.
// Two layout modes, gated by `showCaption`:
//   - off (default): full-bleed icon, no in-tile label. Used by Hub
//     and Systems where a curated logo already carries identity.
//   - on: cover slot shrinks vertically to free a thin band along the
//     bottom edge for a one-line elided name caption. Used by Games
//     and Recents because a long shelf of similar boxart needs
//     per-tile labelling — the focused-tile caption below the grid
//     (ActiveLabel) only identifies one cell at a time.
// In caption mode the loading-state fallback is an hourglass glyph,
// not the wrapping-name text used in non-caption mode — the bottom
// caption already shows the name, so the centred-text fallback would
// just read it twice.
// Parent contract — Tile must be loaded inside a host that exposes:
//   - isSelected: bool   — true when this tile is the focused selection
//   - isFocused:  bool   — true when the section owning this tile has user focus
//   - name:       string — model display name (used by the procedural
//                          fallback while the cover PNG decodes)
//   - coverKey:   string — relative path under resources/images/ (no extension)
//   - favorite:   int    — optional 0/1; shows a small heart badge when 1

    // dirtying strips of up to four neighbours per press. Under Qt's
    // software adaptation on MiSTer that read as choppy navigation on
    // covered grids. That scale was a persistent, per-focus-move cost
