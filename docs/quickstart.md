# Quickstart

## 1. Install prerequisites

Install the pieces you do not already have.

### Linux

**Fedora / RHEL:**
```bash
sudo dnf install qt6-qtdeclarative-devel qt6-qtquickcontrols2-devel \
    qt6-qttools-devel cmake ninja-build mold clang-tools-extra just
```

**Ubuntu / Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt install qt6-declarative-dev qt6-quick-controls2-dev \
    qt6-tools-dev qt6-l10n-tools cmake ninja-build mold \
    clang-tidy clang-format just
```

(If `just` isn't packaged for your distro, install it with
`cargo install --locked just` after Rust is set up.)

### Rust

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
cargo install --locked cargo-nextest cargo-deny
```

### macOS / Windows

macOS is best-effort and not covered in CI. Qt package names change often
enough that Linux is the supported path unless you are prepared to debug local
setup. Windows is not tested; use WSL2.

## 2. Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZaparooProject/zaparoo-launcher.git
cd zaparoo-launcher
just build
```

The first build pulls and compiles the Rust and Qt dependencies. Incremental
builds are much faster after that.

## 3. Start the mock Core

In one terminal:

```bash
just mock-core
```

You should see:

```text
mock-core listening on ws://127.0.0.1:27497/api/v0.1
```

The mock serves three categories (Consoles, Handhelds, Arcade), ten systems,
and fifty games. That is enough data to exercise every launcher screen.

`27497` is offset from the real Core's `7497` so a real Core, or another Core
test instance, can run on the same machine without colliding with the mock. The
launcher still defaults to `7497` in production. `just run-dev` points it at
the mock through `ZAPAROO_CORE_ENDPOINT`; `just run` reads
`~/.config/zaparoo/launcher.toml` as usual.

### Pick a different port

If something already uses `27497`, override it at startup:

```bash
MOCK_CORE_ADDR=127.0.0.1:9000 just mock-core
ZAPAROO_CORE_ENDPOINT=ws://127.0.0.1:9000/api/v0.1 just run-dev
```

`ZAPAROO_CORE_ENDPOINT` always wins over `~/.config/zaparoo/launcher.toml`.

## 4. Run the launcher

In a second terminal:

```bash
just run-dev
```

`run-dev` is windowed and points at the mock. `just run` is the
production-style runner: it respects `~/.config/zaparoo/launcher.toml` and
starts fullscreen.

## 5. Check the result

- The launcher window opens.
- A static **categories row** of tiles fills with "Favorites",
  "Arcade", "Consoles", "Handhelds". Left/Right cycles between them.
  ("Favorites" is a placeholder until a real Favorites endpoint
  lands in Core; selecting it shows an empty systems grid.)
- Pressing Enter drops you into the **paged systems grid** for that
  category. Use Left/Right to move within a page; the grid wraps to
  the next page at the row edge.
- Pressing Enter on a system opens the **paged games grid** (five
  entries per system).
- Pressing Enter on a game sends a `run` RPC to the mock. The mock logs the
  selected game's zap script, but the launcher keeps running because nothing is
  actually launched.
- Pressing Tab on a system or game sends a `readers.write` RPC with the
  selected entry's zap script. The launcher shows a card-write modal while the
  request is pending; the mock logs the write request.
- Escape backs out; Escape on the top level quits.

The FPS counter in the corner should stay green (≥ 55). Red means the UI fell
below 30 FPS and needs investigation.

## 6. Run tests and lints

Before you open a pull request:

```bash
just lint    # clang-format, clang-tidy, qmllint, rustfmt, clippy, cargo-deny
just test    # ctest + cargo nextest
```

Zero warnings is the bar.
