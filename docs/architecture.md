## QML module URIs

| Target | URI | Load path |
|---|---|---|
| zaparoo_launcher_rs (plugin) | `Zaparoo.Browse` | `qrc:/qt/qml/Zaparoo/Browse/` |
| zaparoo_ui_app | `Zaparoo.App` | `qrc:/qt/qml/Zaparoo/App/` |
| zaparoo_ui_screens | `Zaparoo.Screens` | `qrc:/qt/qml/Zaparoo/Screens/` |
| zaparoo_ui_components | `Zaparoo.Ui` | `qrc:/qt/qml/Zaparoo/Ui/` |
| zaparoo_ui_theme | `Zaparoo.Theme` | `qrc:/qt/qml/Zaparoo/Theme/` |

`engine.loadFromModule("Zaparoo.App", "Main")` is the only entry point. Keep
`qrc:/` strings out of the rest of the app.

## Key constraints

- **Software rendering only.** MiSTer has no GPU. Do not use shaders,
  `LinearGradient`, `RadialGradient`, `DropShadow`, `Glow`, `OpacityMask`,
  `MultiEffect`, or `Qt5Compat.GraphicalEffects`. Use `Rectangle`, `Image`,
  `Text`, `Repeater`, `NumberAnimation`, and `ColorAnimation`.

- **Resolution-agnostic layout.** The UI runs from 240p CRT output to 1080p.
  Use `Sizing.pctH()`, `Sizing.pctW()`, and `Sizing.fontSize()` for
  dimensions. Do not hardcode pixel values.

- **FPS counter is always on.** When changing visuals, keep it green (≥55 FPS)
  at 720p+ and above 30 FPS at 240p.

- **Dynamic Qt on desktop, static Qt on MiSTer.** `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` is
  the default for LGPL-compliant desktop distribution. The ARM32 Docker build
  passes `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF` through the Qt CMake toolchain.

## Runtime vs Platform

The launcher tracks two separate facts. Do not collapse them; that is how old
runtime/platform bugs come back.

| Concept | Source of truth | Question answered |
|---|---|---|
| **Runtime** | `zaparoo_core::runtime::current()` (filesystem-cached) | What device is the **launcher binary** running on? |
| **Platform** | `zaparoo_core::platform::subscribe()` (from `version` RPC) | What OS/device is **Zaparoo Core** running on? |

`Runtime == Mister` does **not** imply `Platform == Mister`. The launcher
can run on a desktop while talking to Core on a MiSTer on the network,
or vice-versa.

### When to use which

- **Runtime gate** — use this when the launcher's host device changes the
  behavior. Read `runtime::current()`. Prefer runtime gating for behavior.
- **Build-time cfg `#[cfg(zaparoo_runtime = "mister")]`** — use this only for
  code that should not compile into desktop binaries: system calls,
  MiSTer-only dependencies, and similar. Currently only `mister_runtime.rs`
  uses it. `ZAPAROO_RUNTIME=mister` is set in `cmake/ZaparooRust.cmake` for
  static-Qt ARM32 builds.
- **Platform gate** — use this when a feature depends on what Core supports.
  Subscribe to `platform::subscribe()` and treat `None` as unknown; do not
  enable platform-specific behavior until the first `version` RPC completes.
  Do not gate on `Platform` directly from C++ or QML. Route the decision
  through Rust and expose a QML property.

**Never gate runtime behavior on `Platform`, never gate Core
assumptions on `Runtime`.** They are independent.

## LGPL compliance

Qt is used under LGPLv3. The desktop binary links Qt dynamically, so end
users can replace the bundled Qt libraries. The MiSTer ARM32 binary is
statically linked; object files are available on request per LGPL §4(d)(1).
License texts live in `src/LICENSES/`.

## Rust → QML data flow

The data layer follows the RTK Query shape. A single `Store` owns the `Client`,
hands out shared `RemoteResource<T>` values keyed by `(endpoint NAME, args
hash)`, and routes mutations through the same client. QML singletons subscribe
by binding to an `Endpoint`; `rust/launcher/src/bind.rs` emits the bridge code
for the sync seed, the `qt_thread` watcher, and the property apply step.

```

`RemoteResource<T>` combines the connection FSM and per-fetch state into one
`ResourceStatus<T>`: `Idle`, `Loading`, `Ready(T)`, or
`Errored { message, retrying }`. Each binding reads the current status
synchronously before it spawns the watcher. That closes the MiSTer race where
Core can connect before QML loads and the first screen never updates.

The Qt message handler (`qInstallMessageHandler`) forwards Qt log output to
`zaparoo_log_qt()` in the Rust staticlib. From there it goes through the same
tracing registry as Rust logs. Both end up in stderr and `launcher.log`.

### Navigation state

`Main.qml` extends `MainLayout.qml`. The layout owns the visual tree; `Main.qml`
owns the runtime wiring: key translation, forward-transition orchestration, and
persistence. Screens live under `Zaparoo.Screens` so they can be tested without
embedding the whole application shell.

```
ScreenManager.activeScreen:    "hub" | "systems" | "games"
ScreenManager.modalStack:      list<string>      // top-of-stack receives input
MainLayout.pendingTransition:  "" | "systems" | "games"   // owned by Main.qml
```

Persisted state is split across Rust-backed QML singletons:

| Singleton | Stored fields | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| `Browse.AppState` | `active_screen` | cross-screen route |
| `Browse.HubState` | `category` | hub-screen row selection |
| `Browse.SystemsState` | `system_id` | systems-screen grid selection |
| `Browse.GamesState` | `system_id`, `game_path` | games-screen grid selection |

State is loaded before the first QML frame and written through on user actions.
That is deliberate: MiSTer's parent process can kill and relaunch the launcher
without warning. Each screen writes its own `*State` singleton on directional
moves; the router writes `AppState.active_screen` when the screen flips.

#### Screen flow

- **Hub** (`HubScreen.qml`) — static centered row of category tiles.
  Left/Right cycles categories and writes `HubState.category`. Accept emits
  `requestAccept(category)`; Escape emits `requestQuit`.
- **Systems** (`SystemsScreen.qml`) — paged grid of systems for the active
  category. Directional moves write `SystemsState.system_id`. Accept on a
  Ready system emits `requestAccept(systemId)`; Accept on Empty/Error emits
  `requestAccept("")` so the router can re-fire `set_category` as a retry.
  Escape emits `requestHubScreen`. Tab on a tile emits
  `requestSystemCardWrite(index)`.
- **Games** (`GamesScreen.qml`) — paged grid of games for the active system.
  Accept on Ready calls `GamesModel.launch_at(index)`; Accept on Empty/Error
  re-fires `set_system` against the cached `current_system_id` as the retry.
  Escape emits `requestSystemsScreen` (the router decides whether to land on
  Hub or Systems via `_gamesEnteredFromHub`). Tab on a tile emits
  `requestGameCardWrite(index)`.

#### Forward-transition orchestration

`Main.qml` is the single owner of forward routing. Screens are pure input
dispatchers and never call `set_category` / `set_system` themselves. The
router's flow on a Hub Accept:

1. Set `pendingTransition = "systems"` (tentative). The screen's
   `transitioning` binding flips true and the source row/grid hides.
2. `_ensureCategory(category, cb)` short-circuits when the model is already
   on that category with `count > 0`; otherwise it parks `cb` in the
   `_categoryReadyCallback` slot, restarts a 50 ms `deferredCategorySetTimer`,
   and that Timer calls `SystemsModel.set_category(...)`. The defer is
   essential: `set_category` runs synchronously on the GUI thread and tears
   down `SystemsScreen`'s tile delegates, which freezes the frame budget if
   the "Loading…" cue hasn't painted yet.
3. The router's `Connections { target: Browse.SystemsModel }` fires
   `onLoadingChanged`. When `loading` flips false, the router pulls the
   stored callback, clears the slot, and runs it.
4. Inside that callback the router decides: Arcade-bypass on MiSTer (one
   system, drill straight to Games) or normal Hub→Systems. Arcade-bypass
   re-uses the same machinery via `_ensureSystem(systemId, cb)` against
   `GamesModel`. Hub→Systems calls `_prefetchSystemCovers(cb)` to warm the
   `QPixmapCache` so the destination grid paints with logos in place.
5. `_completeTransition(screen)` clears `pendingTransition` and calls
   `_goto(screen)` which writes `AppState.active_screen`.

Input is gated during the wait: `handleAction` early-returns when
`pendingTransition !== "" && !ScreenManager.hasModal` so a user mashing keys
during the load can't queue a second transition.

There are exactly two `loadingChanged` listeners — one per browse model —
both on the router. There is no cross-screen `Connections` block. There is
no per-screen pending flag. The class of routing bug where a stale
per-screen flag fires while its owning screen isn't even visible cannot
exist when there is no cross-screen state.

Model reset handlers in `Main.qml` restore saved row/grid indices as
catalog data arrives. Missing IDs fall back to index 0 without erasing the
saved value from disk, so a temporary catalog gap does not destroy the
user's last selection.
